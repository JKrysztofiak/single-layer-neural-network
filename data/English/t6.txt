Since the first playground was established, more than fifty community playgrounds have followed, large and small, with involvement from Shane's Inspiration which may include help with design, sourcing materials, grant writing, working with local governments, or other steps in the process. Among their completed projects are Aidan's Place in Westwood,[5] Brandon's Village in Calabasas,[6] Chanticleer Park in Live Oak,[7][8] SEBA Park in Elgin, Illinois,[9] Winwood's Enchanted Playground in Hutchinson, Kansas,[10] Fernangeles Park in Sun Valley, California,[11] and inclusive playgrounds in Cuenca, Ecuador[12] and Bangalore, India.[13]

In addition to the building of physical playgrounds, Shane's Inspiration has developed curricula and social programming to sustain inclusive play at the sites it develops.[14] Shane's Inspiration has also collaborated with Too Small to Fail and equipment manufacturer Landscape Structures Inc., to create playground signage in English and Spanish that encourages conversations between parents and children.[15]
