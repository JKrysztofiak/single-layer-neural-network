Joining the New Zealand Railways Department in 1964, Small rose to become managing director of New Zealand Rail and its successor, Tranz Rail. He retired from Tranz Rail in 2000 and was replaced, as managing director, by Michael Beard in May of that year. Small was then vice-chairman for some time. For his services to the transport industry and the community, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2000 New Year Honours.

In 1999, Small was appointed by the National Government as one of three people on the high-profile INCIS inquiry into the failed computer system that had been ordered by New Zealand Police in the 1990s. Early in 2000 after a change to the Labour Government, the other two members were dispensed with and Small conducted the enquiry by himself. Small's report on INCIS was published in November 2000.
