Ernest Barry was brought almost straight from novice to race for the English Sculling Championship in 1908 against George Towns, who had already won the world championship four times and the English Championship twice. That day, Barry, as well as beating Towns, set up a record over the course which lasted for many years. His time was 21m.12.5s.

In August 1910 he competed for the World Professional sculling championship for the first time. Barry wanted Richard Arnst, the existing champion, to travel to England for the match, which he was willing to do provided certain expenses were met. (Normally a challenger would travel to where the champion lived.) Barry was unable to arrange the expenses, but then the British South Africa Company offered to stage the match in Northern Rhodesia. They believed the match would promote the company and the country. Stakes and expenses were guaranteed by the company, and the match was arranged to be run on the Zambezi River on 18 August 1910. The 3.25-mile race above the Victoria Falls was what may have been the first serious high-altitude competition. The heat and the altitude affected both scullers, but Arnst was the better of the two, and he crossed the line in front of Barry to retain his title.
