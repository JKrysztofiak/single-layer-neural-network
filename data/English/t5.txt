Before high school, Moala did not compete in football. In fact, he was competing in rugby, national sport in his native Tonga. He did, however, attend football games of Grant Union High School, where his older brother Sione was playing. After a game in the 2006 season, Pacers head coach Mike Alberghini spotted Moala in the stands, asking the 300-pounder why he did not play varsity football, only to be stunned to hear that Moala was only 13.[2]

During his freshman year at Grant Union, Moala was not allowed to participate in varsity football, because California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) rules do not allow students under the age of 15 to compete.[3] Moala instead lined-up on the junior varsity, leading the squad to an undefeated record. As a sophomore, in his first year of varsity football, he started at left guard and was a reserve defensive tackle, finishing the year with 55 tackles, 15 tackles for loss, four quarterback sacks, two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. In the CIF Open Division state championship against perennial powerhouse Long Beach Poly, Moala helped Grant to a 25-20 upset.[4]

As a junior, Moala tallied 104 tackles, 36 tackles for loss, and 15 sacks, and returned a blocked kick for a touchdown.[4] He played nose tackle in Grant Union's 3-5-3 defense that allowed only 68 points in 13 games, including eight shutouts, and combined for a state-record 77 sacks.[5] However, while riding a 26-game winning streak into the CIF Division II semifinal, Grant Union was upset by Rocklin High School, 19-21.[6] Still, Moala was named California's Junior Player of the Year, the first lineman to do so since Manny Fernandez of San Lorenzo in 1962.[5] By the end of his junior year, Moala had offers from most of the Pacific-10 Conference.[7]
